# Git Tutorial (with a bit of GitHub)

This hands-on tutorial was created by Bryna Hazelton (@bhazelton), and has been 
taken from https://github.com/uwescience/ds4ad. We start at lesson 3 from that series.

The original lessons contain a number of side-points, questions and exercises. In
this version, we have made these a little more obvious by denoting them as follows:

| Thing | Symbol |
| ------|--------|
| Question for Discussion | :question: |
| Question for later | :grey_question: |
| Exercise | :memo: |
| Exercise for later | :black_nib: |
| Important note | :crossed_flags: |
| Side-note (for later) | :ghost: |
