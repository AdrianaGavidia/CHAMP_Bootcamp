# Git and Github

This directory contains all the elements required for a tutorial in git and github.
Begin by presenting an [overview and motivation for git](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eN6YI7ZBmYrP-TRi1_E1-y7WXwXCG5mbiDYH06txk_k/edit?usp=sharing).

Then proceed to the [hands-on tutorial](tutorial/README.md), before going back to the 
above presentation to finish off with a summary and best-practices.

The hands-on tutorial is designed to be run interactively. The instructor should
keep the notes provided in this repo to themselves, and write out the commands
as they speak. The notes can however be shared later.
