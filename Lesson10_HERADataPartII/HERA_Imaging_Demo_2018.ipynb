That being the case, making and looking at dirty images is good way to get a \"quick-look\" at the data and diagnose possible problems.\n",

    "• `niter=0` means it **will not** attempt to deconvolve the data (which is what we want for now!)\n",
    "\n",
    "• `mode='mfs'` means we are making a ***Multi-Frequency Synthesis*** image, which is just fancy jargon for making a single image using data from all frequencies. Question: what imaging benefit might this give us?\n",
    "\n",
    "• `cell='400arcsec'` this means that the image will have pixels that are 400 arcseconds in size.\n",
    "\n",
    "• `imsize=512` this means that the image will contain 512 cells on each side, to make a 512 x 512 image.\n",
    "\n",
    "• `spw='0:100~924'` means it will use the zeroth spectral window (only one exists anyways) and take channels 100 to 924. We ignore the first and last 100 channels because they are almost always subnominal.\n",

That is to say, point sources in the image are spreading their flux throughout the image in a way governed by the point spread function (PSF). Deconvolution is an attempt to correct for this. There are a few algorithms to do this, but we will stick to the CLEAN algorithm implemented in CASA's `clean` function.\n",

The `mask` parameter takes the following form: `mask = circle[[01h43m00s, -30d48m0s], 32000arcsec]` where the first two numbers tell where to center the circular mask in RA and Dec, and the third number is the size of the mask in arcseconds. **Note:** if you use a mask, don't use the RA Dec values shown here: figure out what the appropriate coordinates should be given your previous dirty image!\n",
