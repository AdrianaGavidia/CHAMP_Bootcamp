# Intro to Computing

This session will introduce computing on a Unix machine, as well as beginning to 
introduce simple Python programming.

Note that the `python_intro` and `git-lab-xxx.pdf` resources here are out of date
and can be ignore for purposes of the 2020 CHAMP camp.

## Unix / Shell

The notes for the unix/shell tutorial are [here](shell_intro_notes.pdf).

## Intro to Python

We will be using the excellent Software Carpentry tutorial [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/index.html)

It is *not* recommended that the students have the tutorial open while going through the
session, but it is a useful resource after the tutorial.
